    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1961, Georg Von Békésy received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his studies in the inner ear. He discovered that the basilar membrane was responsible for frequency selectivity: for the higher frequency sounds, amplitude peaked closer to the base of the basilar membrane, and for the lower frequency sounds, amplitude peaked closer to the apex of the basilar membrane. The following image demonstrates this characteristic of the basilar membrane.\n",

Their model assumed a 2-D flow of perilymph (fluid) in the cochlea. 1-D flow models have an inherent paradox because fluid \"in contact\" with the basilar membrane has a normal velocity to the flow's direction. 3-D flow models can have the lateral component dropped without qualitatively changing the modeling of the basilar membrane.\n",
